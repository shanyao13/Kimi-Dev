We are currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here is the issue text:

--- BEGIN ISSUE ---

{problem_statement}

--- END ISSUE ---

Below are some code segments, each from a relevant file. One or more of these files may contain bugs.

--- BEGIN FILE ---
```
{content}
```
--- END FILE ---

Please first localize the bug based on the issue statement, and then generate \textbf{SEARCH/REPLACE} edits to fix the issue.

Every *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit must use this format:
1. Start with ```diff\n to indicate a diff block, and end the whole block with ```.
2. The file path
3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
5. The dividing line: =======
6. The lines to replace into the source code
7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE

Here is an example:

```diff
### mathweb/flask/app.py
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from flask import Flask
=======
import math
from flask import Flask
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please note that the *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. If you would like to add the line '        print(x)', you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code!

Wrap each *SEARCH/REPLACE* edit in a code block as shown in the example above. If you have multiple *SEARCH/REPLACE* edits, use a separate code block for each one.
